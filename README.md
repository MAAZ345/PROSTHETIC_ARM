# Design and Simulation of Prosthetic Robotic Arm
This GitHub repository hosts the files and code for a prosthetic arm modeled in SolidWorks and simulated using Coppeliasim. The project aims to provide a realistic and dynamic simulation of a prosthetic arm's movements, enabling developers, researchers, and enthusiasts to explore and understand the mechanics of prosthetic limb design.
